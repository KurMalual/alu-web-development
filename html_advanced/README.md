HTML, advanced
In this project, I replicated a figma design with html
/* Bitmap */

position: absolute;
left: -0.28%;
right: -0.28%;
top: -6.04%;
bottom: 9.52%;

background: radial-gradient(85.9% 85.9% at 50% 14.1%, rgba(41, 48, 61, 0.0001) 0%, #071629 100%), #000000;
background-blend-mode: normal, color;
